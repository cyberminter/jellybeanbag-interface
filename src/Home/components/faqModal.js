            <h2> 1: What happens when I bag jellybeans</h2>
      <p>When you buy Bean, your BNB, AVAX, or ETC gets locked into the jellybeanbag Cat smart contract and rewards you with 8% daily return every day.</p>

      <h2>2: Can I take my initial coins back?</h2>
     <p> Over Time! Beans are not bought, Bags are filled and therefore they can't be sold. Once Beans are bought they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of Coins at a starting rate of 8% daily.</p>

      <h2>3: How much are my fees?</h2> 
     <p> There is a small 3% dev fee in order to pay for marketing costs and developing the jellybeanbag ecosystem</p>

      <h2> 4: When is the best time to Buy Bean? </h2>
      <p>Always! No matter when you hire miners, you will begin with a return rate of 8% daily.</p>

      <h2> 5: How often should I re-bag (compound)?  </h2>
     <p> WE recommend that you compound at least once per day but you are free to do so as often as you wish.</p>

      <h2> 6: How is jellybeanbag  sustainable?  </h2>
      <p>jellybeanbag is sustained by continued community support, just as every other crypto coin, token or project. The difference is that since there is no token, there is no price to dump. As long as BNB, AVAX, or ETC is in the contract, there will be rewards!</p>

      <h2>  7: How to use jellybeanbag on my phone?  </h2>
      <p>You can either use an app with a dapp browser and choose the Metamask/Injected option or simply use any browser that you want and choose WalletConnect to connect to your wallet's app on your phone.</p>

      <h2>8: Is it better to re-bag  or sell beans?  </h2>
      <p>By design, rebags will be more profitable than petting in the long-term.</p>

      <h2> 9: How do referrals work?  </h2>
      <p>Once your BNB, AVAX, or ETC wallet is connected to the  Miner website, you will notice your referral address appear at the bottom of the page. When a new user hires miners after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send a BNB value equal to 12% instantly to your beans. Be smart, use it to feed cats and build yourself a stream of income.</p>
